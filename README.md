Chapter 9 Notes

The stack holds Java methods and local variables, while the heap or garbage collector holds objects.

Instance variables are declared in class outside of a method, while local variables are declared in the method's parameter or inside of the method.

Instance variables live on the heap.

Object reference variables declared as local variables go on the stack.

Objects always belong in the heap, regardless of whether the reference variable is declared a local or instance variable.

Methods are on the stack, in order, with the latest method at the top.

In a stack, local variables are stored with their method.

Instance variables reside on the heap within their class.

You cannot have two constructors with the same arguments. (overloaded constructors must have a different argument list).

Instance variables are assigned default values when a value has not been set.
